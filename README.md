### Hey-hey! 🚀 
I'm Anna, and this is my coding world! 💡 Here you'll find me when I'm not analyzing data, building web applications, or exploring artificial intelligence.🤖

##### Some facts about me:
- I've been playing chess for over 10 years ♟️
- I've debugged code while sleepwalking (true story!) 😴💻

##### My skills:

- `**Python Lover** `🐍: From data analysis with Pandas to crafting automation scripts and building web applications, Python is my language of choice.
